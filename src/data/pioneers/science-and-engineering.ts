    longBio: "Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 35-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she calculated the trajectories, launch windows, and emergency return paths for many flights including early NASA missions in the 1960s and the Earth Resources Technology Satellite, and she was known for verifying the calculations made by early electronic computers.",
